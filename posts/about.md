Hi, I'm DeGatchi. A 21 y/o self-taught anon dev w/ only a highschool education (no degree & not studying), living in Australia, that enjoys bringing ideas to life.

**I'm available to hire!**

For any inquiries regarding contracting/hiring, please dm me on twitter **[@DeGatchi](https://twitter.com/DeGatchi)**.

## Interests

Dark-web, low-level reverse engineering, decentralisation, automation, web3 + rust.

## Brief

I specialise in Solidity smart-contracts and Rust development.

I'm currently not occupied with any positions (feel free to dm me on twitter).

I'm working on a personal project in my spare time: a bytecode decoder that _only_ requires bytecode (e.g, calldata + contract bytecode).

## Traits

My biggest strengths are my burning desire to learn and drive to solve problems. I tend to think of out-of-the-box solutions for arising problems to try and innovate.

I'm a serial learner with an obsessive personality. When I set my mind on something, theres no going back until the task is finished or I get to a point where I can't upgrade it anymore/the time-opportunity cost isn't worth it anymore and work on something else that will produce a higher value:time ratio.

I would rather stay inside and code instead of going out. I'm able to be very introverted in order to hone in on whatever project I'm working on but am extroverted when in a social setting.
